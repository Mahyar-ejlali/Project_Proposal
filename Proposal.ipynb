    "The “Labor Hours Estimation” will introduce a machine learning program that the Repair Shop managers could use to plan freight car work for each production line and manage the required labor hours in each day. Accurate labor hour estimation on average will mean that more cars could be in service and more labors and equipment could be utilized."
